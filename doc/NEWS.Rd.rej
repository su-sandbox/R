+       \item \code{socketConnection()} and \code{socketAccept()} have a new
+       argument \code{options} which allows socket-specific options to
+       be set. It defaults to \code{getOption("socketOptions")}.
+       Currently only one option \code{"no-delay"} is implemented which
+       enables the \code{TCP_NODELAY} option on the socket. Options are
+       considered optional so no error is issued if the operating
+       system does not support or honor the option.
